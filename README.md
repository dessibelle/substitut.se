# Substitut

**substitut.se** is a vegan recipe site with focus on usability. I started
working on substitut.se as I found that alltough the internet was is full of recipes 
of tasty vegan dishes they were not so easy to find and when I did find them I often 
found the site to be inaccessible in one way or another. So I started making a 
site of my own.
